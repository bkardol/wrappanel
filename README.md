# WrapPanel - For UWP Applications
As the VariableSizedWrapGrid and ItemsWrapGrid in UWP both take either user defined sizes or take the size of the first child it isn't easy to display a collection of items with various sizes. Exactly for this case I built the WrapPanel.

Please have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/bkardol/wrappanel/wiki) to find out what it looks like and how to use it.
